## My process
- It mostly started off slow as I work my way down.
- Layout and responsiveness was a problem for me since i have a 14-inch display, so it was hard to determine how it should look on bigger screen.
- I got stuck because I thought using too many Div elements would make it look bad. But the process afterwards are mostly smooth.

### Built with
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- CSS Flexbox
- External font files

### What I learned

- Using mobile phones with live server to check for responsiveness on mobile.
- It was a lot easier once you start doing with what you know, although of course it can be done better.

### Continued development
- Definitely looking to use grid more often.
- If there is a better way than div, I would try.

### Useful resources
- This task didn't need much help apparently.
